# portfolio

A portfolio website built with Next.js and Tailwind.

Following this awesome tutorial by <a href="https://github.com/fireclint/">fireclint</a>:<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMx51wpd7g4

However, I

- added necessary "SEO stuff"
- optimized loading speeds
- improved mobile scaling
- improved accessibility
- added OG tags
- created my own (a bit more minimalistic) portfolio page design
- replaced the contact form with my own (VERY minimalistic) layout
- and had a little bit of fun here and there, like with the tailwind animation at the contact me page :)
