# portfolio

A portfolio website built with Next.js and Tailwind.

Following this awesome tutorial by <a href="https://github.com/fireclint/">fireclint</a>:<br/>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMx51wpd7g4

However, I
  - added some necessary "SEO stuff" 
  - optimized loading speeds
  - improved mobile scaling
  - also created my own (a bit more minimalistic) portfolio page design
  - replaced the contact form with my own (VERY minimalistic) layout
  - and had a little bit of fun here and there, like with the tailwind animation at the contact me page :)

Still under construction...
