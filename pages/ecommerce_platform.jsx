                <p className='py-8 lg:pr-10 text-gray-600'>
                  In 2020, the support for Magento 1 was ending, which meant we had to change our eCommerce platform. 
                  At the time, we had accumulated 5 years of experience in online sales, and it was clear that we were 
                  continuing with that path. However, as we sell second-hand items, our workflow differs greatly from 
                  the average online shop&#39;s, and finding a well-suited platform can be difficult.
                </p>
                <p className='lg:pr-10 text-gray-600'>
                  I was responsible for documenting the technical requirements, reviewing potential platform 
                  options and organizing the competitive tenders. After a thorough evaluation process, we chose 
                  Nethit Omnisell to be our next platform. 
                </p>

              <p className='pt-8 text-gray-600'>
                Migrating from Magento to Nethit proved to be a challenging process. Just getting the product 
                data out from the old database into the new platform was complicated, since we already had more 
                than 100 000 products at the time. Also, this was in 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic became 
                global, and we had to close down most of our operations. My team was effectively reduced to 
                me, one graphic designer and a copywriter. However, we were able to build the new platform in 
                about four months. The launch itself was successful, without any significant technical setbacks.
              </p>

                Changing an eCommerce platform is always a risk, but so far, we have been satisfied with the results. 
                The impact on sales has been positive overall. Although, we did notice a significant drop in traffic, 
                despite all the measures taken to maintain the domain rankings (transferring all relevant content, 
                extensive redirects, SEO audits, etc.). At the same time, our conversion rate increased substantially, 
                resulting in better sales figures in general. In just two years we have already sold more on the current 
                platform than we did in five years with Magento.
